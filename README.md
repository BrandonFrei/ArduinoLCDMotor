# ArduinoLCDMotor

The goal of this project is to work with threads, timers, and interrupts.

When finished, the code will allow for the stepper motor to rotate until a user presses a button to switch the direction of rotation. Upon pressing the button, the lcd monitor will also switch to display the new direction, as well as update the current step that the motor is on.

The code can be changed so that either the motor switches direction every cycle, or every push of the button.
